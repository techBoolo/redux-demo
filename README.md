## Introduction
A step by step building of a counter application using redux state management for the counter, starting from creating the 'state', 'action' and 'reducer'

## Technologies
* node v14.15.0
* redux v4.1.0

## Installation
1. Clone the repository

  `git clone https://github.com/techboolo/redux-demo.git`
2. install packages

  `npm install`

## Usage

  `node index.js`

## Status
It is enough to demonstrate a simple use case of redux, but can be extended by including multiple state properties and partitioning the states in their own reducer to demonstrate multiple reducer usage.
